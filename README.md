# NovelUI
a node-based user-interface for NovelAI

## Installation
Download source code.

Install python.

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (you'll need to install more than whats listed, i haven't finished making this yet).

Create a file called `.env` and add in the line `key='NOVELAI_TOKEN_HERE'`.

Launch main.py

Run `pip install <package>` for all the missing stuff that aren't yet in the requirements file.

## Usage
The top bar has lists of nodes.
- Each node has some inputs and an output
- Most should make sense, if you don't understand something spam me in a discord server somewhere. I'll write some actual documentation at a later date.
- Scroll, or use the slider at the bottom, to zoom in and out.
- Press and hold M and you can move around the screen with your mouse.
- Arrow keys move around the scene.
- Click on an output node to spawn a connection, let go on top of an input node to add it.
- Click an input node to delete its connection.
- Select nodes by using your mouse to draw a selection or just click on one and press delete to delete it.
- Selected nodes can also be moved around together.
